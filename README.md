## Project task
Project task was to build a simple Instagram copy by following the tutorial ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUe91uOx7R0)) with pictures storing in the database and animations on the website.

## Project overview
I followed along the tutorial and managed to make all the stuff, all of the images save nicely in the database, animations work flawlessly. It was a good project to get me more familiar with React and how it works.
